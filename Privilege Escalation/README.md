## Generic Tips
* Try to understand what the target system's operational purpose is. Obtaining the system's hostname and basic system information can often help with this.
* Once a non-admin shell has been obtained on a system, do a netstat and compare it to the nmap scan results. There may be "hidden" (ie. blocked or internally-accessible-only) services that can be accessed and exploited locally or via port forwarding.
